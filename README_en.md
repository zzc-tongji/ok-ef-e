## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following in order:

1. **Install path**: Install under a pure English path (e.g., `D:\Games\ok-ef`). Avoid `C:\Program Files` or folders
   with non-ASCII characters.
2. **Antivirus**: Add the install directory to your antivirus (including Windows Defender) allow-list to avoid
   deletion/quarantine.
3. **Display settings**:
    * Disable all GPU filters (such as NVIDIA Game Filter) and sharpening features, unless certain features specifically
      require them.
    * Use the game’s default brightness settings.
    * Disable overlays (MSI Afterburner, FPS counters, etc.).
4. **Custom keybinds**: If you changed in-game keybinds, sync them in `ok-ef` settings. Only listed keys are supported.
5. **Software version**: Ensure you’re running the latest `ok-ef` release.
6. **Game performance**: Keep the game at a stable **60 FPS**. If unstable, lower graphics or resolution.
7. **Disconnects**: If frequent, launch the game manually for 5 minutes before running this tool, or re-login directly
   after disconnect without exiting the game.
8. **Get help**: If all above fails, submit a detailed error report via the community channels.
9. **Game/Software language**: Some features support Simplified Chinese only.

## 💻 Developer Zone

### Run from source (Python)

This project supports **Python 3.12 only**. Run CMD, PyCharm, or VSCode as **Administrator**.

```bash
# Install or update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Run Release version
python main.py

# Run Debug version
python main_debug.py
```

### Command-line arguments

You can auto-start tasks via CLI:

```bash
# Example: start the first task and exit after completion
ok-ef.exe -t 1 -e
```

* `-t` or `--task`: Automatically run the Nth task. `1` is the first task in the list（file [./src/config.py](./src/config.py) list `onetime_tasks`）as daily task.
* `-e` or `--exit`: Exit automatically after the task completes.

### Development debug & tests

```bash
# Run all scripts under tests/ (PowerShell)
./run_tests.ps1

# Or run unittest case-by-case
python -m unittest tests/TestEssenceRecognizer.py
```

For OCR/template/color-recognition features, prefer debugging with `main_debug.py` and inspect logs/screenshots for
faster diagnosis.
